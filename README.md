# Codrift

A lightweight, AI-first desktop IDE built on Tauri v2 and React. Codrift combines a Monaco-based code editor, an integrated terminal, full LSP support, and a native AI agent panel into a single application.

---

## Features

### Editor

- **Monaco editor** — the same engine that powers VS Code, with syntax highlighting for 20+ languages
- **LSP integration** — autocomplete, diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, find usages, rename, and code actions over JSON-RPC stdio; servers are started on demand per file extension
- **Inline completions** — AI-powered inline suggestions via the configured provider
- **Format on save** — triggers the LSP formatter when enabled
- **EditorConfig support** — per-file indent style and tab size read from `.editorconfig`
- **Bracket pairs, rulers, minimap, sticky scroll, inlay hints** — all individually toggled in settings
- **Mouse-wheel font zoom** — configurable
- **Word wrap toggle** — available from the status bar
- **Find and replace** — built-in panel with case-sensitive, whole-word, and regex modes
- **Cursor position history** — navigate back and forward through past positions with Alt+Left / Alt+Right
- **Merge conflict resolution** — inline conflict region detection and accept/reject bar
- **Inline AI edit** — select code, invoke a natural-language instruction to rewrite it in place
- **Markdown preview** — rendered side-by-side preview for `.md` files
- **Symbol search** — document-level and workspace-level symbol navigation
- **Peek panel** — inline reference and definition peek without leaving the current file
- **Git gutter** — inline +/~/- annotations showing unstaged changes
- **Auto-save** — debounced save on every change; toggled per workspace
- **Tab pinning** — pin important files to keep them from being closed
- **Split editor pane** — open a second editor pane side-by-side
- **Reopen closed tab** — recover recently closed tabs

### File Explorer

- Lazy-loading tree with expand/collapse state persisted per workspace
- Virtual scrolling for large directory trees
- File and directory creation, rename, and delete from context menu
- Bookmarks for quick access to frequently used files and folders
- Material file-type icons

### Integrated Terminal

- xterm.js with a native PTY spawned by the Rust backend via `portable-pty`
- Multiple terminal sessions per workspace; each tab is independently named
- Split terminal — run two sessions side-by-side
- Shell profile picker: Default ($SHELL), zsh, bash, sh, fish
- Port detection — terminal output is scanned for `localhost:PORT` patterns; detected ports are shown as clickable links
- In-terminal search (Ctrl+F) powered by the xterm.js search addon
- Theme synchronization — terminal colors update immediately when the app theme changes
- Sessions are scoped per workspace but PTY processes stay alive when switching workspaces

### AI Agent Panel

The AI panel has two modes:

**Built-in chat** — a conversational interface backed by the configured AI provider (Ollama or a custom OpenAI-compatible API). Supports:
- Threaded conversations persisted per workspace
- 16 built-in tools: file read/write/edit, directory tree, git status/diff/log/commit, run commands, search, glob, and more
- Slash commands: `/commit`, `/pr`, `/review`, `/fix`, `/test`, `/explain`, `/refactor`, `/diff`, `/compact`, and more
- `/compact` — partial compress that summarizes old context while keeping recent messages verbatim
- Skill injection via system prompt (from Settings > Skills)
- File and folder attachment context, image attachments, @mention files
- Memory: user preferences (`~/.codrift/user.md`) and project memory (`AGENTS.md`) injected into every session
- Chat modes: Agent, Plan, Debug, Ask

**CLI agent runner** — launches supported AI coding agents in a dedicated terminal. Supported agents:

| Agent | Binary | Session resume |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `--resume` |
| Codex | `codex` | `codex resume` |
| Gemini | `gemini` | `--resume` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `--continue` |
| Pi | `pi` | — |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `gh copilot suggest` | — |
| Cursor Agent | `cursor --agent` | — |

Session IDs are captured from terminal output and persisted per workspace so previous sessions can be resumed across app restarts. Each agent can be enabled/disabled and given a custom binary path.

### Git

- Status panel showing staged and unstaged changes with file status icons
- Stage, unstage, and discard individual files or hunks
- Commit with message editor
- Hunk viewer — inline diff of each changed hunk
- Stash manager — create, apply, and delete stashes
- Git log viewer — commit history with diff
- Branch switcher and new-branch creation from the status bar

### Search

- Workspace-wide full-text search with real-time results
- Case-sensitive, whole-word, and regex modes
- Include/exclude glob filters
- Find-and-replace across all matching files

### Local History

- Automatic snapshot of every saved file revision stored locally
- Browse per-file history with timestamps
- Preview and restore any previous version

### Workspace Management

- Multiple workspaces open simultaneously as tabs in the titlebar
- Each workspace maintains independent: open files, active file, split pane, side panel, bottom panel, terminal sessions, expanded directories, and layout mode
- Workspace state (open tabs, cursor positions, scroll positions) is persisted and restored on next launch
- Recent workspaces list with fuzzy search
- CLI integration — pass a file path or directory path as a command-line argument to open it at launch

### Settings

- **General** — auto-save, confirm on quit, tab size, font size, minimap, word wrap, indent guides, sticky scroll, inlay hints, code actions, inline completions, format on save, keybinding customization
- **AI Providers** — configure Ollama (endpoint + model) or a custom OpenAI-compatible API (endpoint, model, API key)
- **Skills** — create, edit, and delete Markdown skill files injected as system prompts
- **Memory** — edit user memory (`~/.codrift/user.md`) and project memory (`AGENTS.md`) directly in settings
- **Appearance** — dark / light / system theme, editor font family, VS Code theme import
- **About / Licenses**

### Appearance

- Dark, light, and system (auto) themes
- Custom theme support using a JSON schema mapped to CSS custom properties
- VS Code theme import — upload any VS Code `.json` theme file and it is translated to the Codrift theme format
- Custom editor font family

### Other

- **Quit confirmation** — optional dialog when there are unsaved files
- **Auto-updater** — background update check with in-titlebar download progress and restart prompt
- **Single-instance enforcement** — a second launch focuses the existing window
- **macOS native** — custom titlebar with traffic-light integration and drag region

## LSP Support

Servers are started automatically when a file with a recognized extension is opened. The following language servers are supported out of the box (installed separately):

| Language | Server | Install |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` | `brew install rust-analyzer` |
| Python | `pyright-langserver` | `npm install -g pyright` |
| Go | `gopls` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |
| CSS / SCSS / Less | `vscode-css-language-server` | `npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted` |
| HTML | `vscode-html-language-server` | `npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted` |
| JSON | `vscode-json-language-server` | `npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted` |
| Svelte | `svelteserver` | `npm install -g svelte-language-server` |
| Vue | `vue-language-server` | `npm install -g @vue/language-server` |
| Tailwind CSS | `tailwindcss-language-server` | `npm install -g @tailwindcss/language-server` |
| YAML | `yaml-language-server` | `npm install -g yaml-language-server` |
| TOML | `taplo` | `cargo install taplo-cli --locked` |

Custom server binaries can be placed in `~/.codrift/servers/` and will take precedence over PATH.
